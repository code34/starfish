# starfish

Starfish is an my first horizontal scrolling shooter test wich was made with Gamemaker2.

The aim was to build a little game containing one intro, one level, one boss, one end. The game must also include most of the standard elements: life, collision, score, gui

Credits to my children who made the monster sprites.
Music was quicly done with Maschine & native studio
